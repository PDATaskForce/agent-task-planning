# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Moved to PDA Platform

**This repository has been archived and is no longer maintained.**

All development has moved to the **PDA Platform monorepo**:

👉 **https://github.com/PDA-Task-Force/pda-platform**

## What Happened?

agent-task-planning, pm-data-tools, and pm-mcp-servers have been consolidated into a single monorepo for better:
- Unified versioning

- **Issues:** https://github.com/PDA-Task-Force/pda-platform/issues
- **PyPI:** `pip install agent-task-planning` (still works - published from monorepo)

## Installation

Nothing changes for users:

pip install agent-task-planning
```

The package is still published to PyPI from the monorepo.
